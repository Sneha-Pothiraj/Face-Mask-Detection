# Face-Mask-Detection
Face mask detector built using OpenCV, TensorFlow/ Keras using Deep Learning and Computer vision concepts to detect face masks in real-time video streams.

# Installation
1. Clone the repository
```
$ git clone https://github.com/Sneha-Pothiraj/Face-Mask-Detection.git

```

2. Change your directory to the cloned repo 
```
$ cd Face-Mask-Detection
```

3. Create a Python virtual environment named 'test' and activate it
```
$ virtualenv test
```
```
$ source test/bin/activate
```

4. Now, run the following command in your Terminal/Command Prompt to install the libraries required
```
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
# Working
1. Open terminal. Go into the cloned project directory and type the following command:
```
$ python3 train_mask_detector.py --dataset dataset
```

2. To detect face masks in an image type the following command: 
```
$ python3 detect_mask_image.py --image images/pic1.jpeg
```

3. To detect face masks in real-time video streams type the following command:
```
$ python3 detect_mask_video.py 
```
